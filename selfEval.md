# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
  - I think that my time management could use some practice. I am completing assignments on time, I think it just takes me 25% longer than I think it will. I need to account for some concepts that I won't understand right of the bat. One thing that I think has been helping me is writing down a list of things I need to do an a prediction of how much time it will take me to do those things. When I'm finished, I look back at how much time I thought I would spend on it and how much time I actually spent on it. It provides good feedback for how long certain tasks take me.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
  - A function is like your instructions on how to set up your playmobile - it contains steps on how to set up your toy.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
  - My understanding of arguments and parameters is that parameters create the skeleton, while the arguments put the substance into the skeleton. Whatever order the skeleton is in, is the order the substance will be in.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
  - Though I do have an okay grasp on the ordering of parameters and arguments, I would love to go through some examples in real time.
